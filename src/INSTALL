How-to install Rasende-Roboter-Solver ?

Install from binaries:

======================================================================
Install from the sources:

Requirements:
- first, a git client to fetch the sources
- then you need to obtain the sources from: http://github.com/LucHermitte/Rasende
  -> cd /some/path
  -> mkdir rasende
  -> git clone git@github.com:LucHermitte/Rasende.git repository 
- CMake (http://www.cmake.org) v2.8.4+ (I haven't tested with previous
  versions)
- a C++ compiler
  - with hash_map (from SGI, STLPort, from old GCC or VC++ versions), or C++11
    std::unordered_map<>
  - in case you are using GCC, you have to be sure to have a version > 4.6, or
    to fix bitset implementation according to this bug report:
    http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=45713

Once all requirements are met, you're ready to go on.

Makefiles generation:
As usually with CMake, it's highly recommended to build the project outside of
the sources directory.
Let's say you have put the source code in: /some/path/rasende/repository/
You can put the build directory in: /some/path/rasende/build/, or if you use
my local_vimrc plugin and configuration, in /some/path/rasende/build-r/.
-> cd /some/path/rasende
-> mkdir build-r
-> cd build-r
-> cmake ../repository

You may want to set the compilation mode to Release, or set the install
directory to something different from /usr/local/. In that case, use ccmake
(or cmake-gui) instead of cmake.
Note: It would be the same under windows, just use \ instead of / for your
paths.

The compilation:
Just continue with:
-> make
and may be "make install" if you want a clean install of this pet project.


If you want to obtain the doxygen documentation, you will require doxygen
(http://www.doxygen.org), and dot. The HTML pages are generated with 
-> make doc
Then open /some/path/rasende/build-r/dox/html/index.html


And now enjoy!
